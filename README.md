The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model using oneAPI to predict the likelihood of an individual having cardiovascular disease. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and the capabilities of oneAPI, this project offers an efficient and accurate method for early detection of cardiovascular disease.

## Project Overview üìãü©∫üìä

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing its progression and improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a set of medical data, including factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant attributes, to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** A dataset containing medical records of individuals, including their health attributes and cardiovascular disease status, is collected and prepared for analysis. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering:** Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, new features may be derived or engineered from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines, are employed to train predictive models using the preprocessed data. The models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision and recall.

4. **Model Deployment and Integration:** Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed as a predictive tool. Integration with the oneAPI allows for efficient execution on different hardware platforms, such as CPUs or GPUs, maximizing performance and scalability.

5. **Prediction and Risk Assessment:** The trained model can be used to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease for new, unseen individuals. This enables early detection, risk assessment, and personalized intervention strategies for patients.
